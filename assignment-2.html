                        Once you are the rightful owner of a piece of work, you can provide authorization for others to use your work or sell that product for you. This is commonly referred to as “licenses” and may or may not entail paying for the rights. An example;
                        When someone makes a game they sell Licenses for platforms to sell that product and provide them licenses to the end users. Steam is a common place that game developers turn too to sell their products. Steam will provide a service where people can buy that game for a fee and then steam and the owners take a cut from that.

                    1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them
                </h1>

                <p>
                    One of the most common web page accessibility issues are people who have a vision impairment or those who have problems hearing. Sometimes a common fix to people having vision impairments is a text to speech system or they have someone who can help them navigate the website. An accessibility feature could be that there are captions on the screen for when someone is speaking, so a hard of hearing person can read and follow on with what is being said.
