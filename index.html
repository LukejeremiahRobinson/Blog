                    About me and why I came to Code Nation 
                </h2>
            
                <p>
                    The reason I came to Code Nation is to get some more ICT skills under my belt. I have a very wide range of ICT skills. I come from an IT background, I did an ICT course back in college which was a hardware and networking course which I got passes and merits across the board. After finishing the course I bounced around from it job and finally settled at a place called Aspect IT. After spending a year there they decided that they no longer needed me and I was left unemployed. After some time of being unemployed I spoke to my work coach and they informed me about Code Nation. I have always been interested in coding and web development, having done some back in college.

                    Code Nation has helped me to learn the basics on how to code and make websites and I look forward to taking what I have learned into the next stage of my life and working life. I love to learn and I feel like thanks to Liam and Leona that I have picked up so much and managed to get past all my mistakes. Now I feel more confident in my ability.
