<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h2>
    <p>   

        IT plays a massive part in any working business. Not only for your everyday use but for the little things like data management, learning, getting information about anything really quickly and so much more. IT has made a massive improvement to the way we look at business. The most notable is that it has sped up the way we work. For example, Microsoft products allow us to edit text documents on the fly or even search for any keyword in a document. We are able to write text so fast and get information in a structured format and that so many people can access it at one time. This has also brought on the development for servers and the software to run them servers. The ICT business is one of the fastest growing industries on the planet and it is only getting bigger.

        Another purpose of IT in modern business to expand the business though advancement and website development. If your business has a good website then they are more likely to get some kind of business as you look professional. You can also communicate much better with clients and new clients. Another positive for the ICT world is we can offer fast shipment options to move products over a larger area and get them to people much faster.

        1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully â€“ what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
    </h3>
    <p>
    There are many tools that help us to make Projects better these tools are Websites, Apps and some hardware. Websites help us get information and give information about products or a product or service you are selling. Another way to make a project have some success is with great teamwork and be able to problem solve. The Apps that we are using to make our life easier is Slack. Slack has helped us to make a group chat where we could chat and pass on images and other useful information. We used slack to set up meeting and then get an idea what we were doing during the day. We have also used a website called Trello which we used to get an outline all the tasks that we wanted to do and when we finished them tasks they would be marked off the to do list so we can then move to focus on something else or more important. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Teamwork is one of the most important parts of digital projects. This is because each person  can focus on one given task or multiple people can focus on one task and work together on that task.
